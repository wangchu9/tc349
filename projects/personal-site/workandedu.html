<h1>Work and Education</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>I came to America for high school about seven years ago. I went to a private school called St. Andrew's Sewanee School, which was located on a mountain in Tennessee. Since that school was on a mountain, it was more like a prison for me. The school was surrounded by trees and lots of trees. Students were isolated from the outside world. The closest Mcdonald was 20 minutes away by driving. After four years of suffering in high school, I finally made it to college! I love Michigan State University so much! I have complete freedom here. There are so many different people I can meet and so many opportunities to explore.</p>

<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I had worked at a Chinese restaurant for one year. I got that job because i understand Chinese and Chinese food. Currently, I am searching for internships or jobs that are more challenging.</p>
