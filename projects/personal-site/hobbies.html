<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<h2>Swimming</h2>
<p>The only sport that I am interested in is swimming because that is the only sport can cool you down. </p>

<h2>Car</h2>
<p>Like all other men, I like to watch those expensive cars.</p>

<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>I like to go to different countries to experience different culture. Being an international student for seven years, I uderstand that you can learn much more from traveling than studying. </p>
