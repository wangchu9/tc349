      The mobile site that I often access from is Priceline.com. I don’t usually view websites on my iphone because the screen is too small to display all of the information.  However, the mobile site of Priceline is actually perfectly designed for mobile phone users due to the simplification of information. On the home page of their mobile site, there are only six buttons, three main buttons and three secondary buttons. Although six buttons might sound like too little of them, the three main buttons actually can satisfy most of users’ needs. People use price line to book hotels, rent cars, or book flights. The three main buttons provide just enough functionality to satisfy those needs.       Besides that, a more important point is that the site is so simple. There is not extra and unnecessary information such as ads. The mobile site only shows necessary information. Personally, I think browsing this site on a mobile device is easier than browsing it on a computer.
