      In my own opinion, the designers of this site definitely put a lot of effort into the site, especially on graphic part of the site. The graphic on the very top and the very bottom of the site are very eye-catching. However, personally, I think it would look better if they move the sentence, ÒYour videos belong here.Ó, to somewhere else, the top part would look nicer. That sentence is just annoying when it is put on a pretty graphic. Also, the joining Vimeo bar should also be moved for the same reason.       Moreover, I think there are too many content on the main page of the site. It makes me feel like they want to squeeze all the information to viewers at the beginning. I reckon that those contents would just confuse viewers, and they would have a bad impression on the site. Therefore,  the designers of the site should create separate pages for those contents and use their home page to make some eye-catching graphics.
