      In my own opinion, this website is well designed. Everything is well organized. Viewers can easily navigate through different pages because the navigation bars are identical on all pages. Viewers would not be confused when navigating the site. Also, this site demonstrates its contents in a clear and organized way as well. For example, on the main page of this site, it organizes the four advantages of its cloud application platform in a block. Viewers can navigate all these for advantages in an untraditional way. Personally, I believe the way the site let viewers navigate will raise viewers’ interest level in the cloud application platform.       Moreover, on the “How it Works” page, there is an interactive graph that allows viewers to have some interaction with it as they try to understand the way their product works. That is a pretty important element because it not only demonstrates the quality of the site but also create an great impression on the company’s level of ability.
