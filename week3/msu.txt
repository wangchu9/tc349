\f0\fs24 \cf0 I like the MSU website a lot! From my own point of view, this site meets all of my requirements of perfect websites. It has clear directions that allow viewers to find what they are looking for. I remember my first impression on this website when I was applying for colleges. I had no problem finding information that I needed. It seems like this site is getting better after these years. It only shows some important news to viewers. Also, there are no extra words that viewers need to read. I believe that is the most important principle in designing a website because people are lazy. They don\'92t want to see too much before something catch their attention.
