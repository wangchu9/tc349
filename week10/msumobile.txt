      I browsed the mobile site using my iphone. My first impression on this site was pretty good. This mobile site was actually much better than I expected. Originally, I reckoned MSU would not put too much effort on a mobile site. However, this mobile site actually worked very well. The whole site looked extremely clear and simple, and I love the way the designer use icons on the home page as navigations. Using icons allow users to easily find the information they need. That is extremely crucial when browsing a website on a smart phone because the screen size limits the amount of information you can see. The MSU mobile site truly did a great job eliminating unnecessary information. 	Although the home page is well designed, the other web pages are not as good as the home page. If you click into ÒAbout MSUÓ, there is a list of topics. Each one of them leads you to a more detail web page. If you check all of them, you will find out that they are not perfectly designed for mobile phones. The pictures on top of each page are cut off. Also, the lay out of those pages are just like the layout of a full site.
