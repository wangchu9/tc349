<h3>A little bit about myself</h3>
<p>My name is Bryan. I am an international student from Taiwan. I major in Media Technology at Michigan State University. I choose this major because I want to become a web designer. I like to see websites that are clean and organized. Therefore, I would like to learn more web skills so that I can create different styles of websites. Moreover, I am interested in all kinds of high-tech products. Therefore, my second goal is to understand different products and how to sell them and how to introduce their merits to customers.</p>

<h3>Critique of panic.com</h3>

<p>From my own point of view, I like the way that this website put the icons of their products directly on their main page. The main page looks pretty clean, and all the important information is right there! Also, I love the way they make the icons enlarge and show a few sentences of introduction. I believe that most people would prefer not to read too much before they have some idea about things. The way this website displays their products is simple and neat! It is easy to get information from this site!</p>

<p>There is only one thing that I donâ€™t like about this site, and that is the way they put their company icon. I think there should be a clear difference between their product icons and the company icon so that viewers can distinguish which is which. If I was the designer, I would move the icon to either the top right or top left because their products are in the middle. </p>
