<p class="p1">From my own point of view, this website uses bright colors and grids to demonstrate a clean view for its’ visitors. It uses light blue and light grey as its main color scheme. Also, the prices of their products are also in light green. All these light colors allow visitors to understand the kind of style that this website creates. Moreover, this website puts all objects in boxes in order to separate and clarify different sections. I believe most of visitors would agree that the designer of this website successfully show visitors a clean and clear shopping site that they would be comfortable interacting with.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span></span>However, if I am the designer of the website, there are two things that I would do to make it better. First, I would make the font size larger. Since there are not too many words on the first page, it would be easier for people to read if the words are larger. Second, I would also make the browsing options on the left side bigger buttons. Since there are only ten options, bigger buttons would look nicer and not too messy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
