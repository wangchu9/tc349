¡@¡@In my own opinion, this is a good website. However, there is one change that can make it better. One improvement that can be done is to make images of each story larger. Personally, when I see images and texts are put into grids that have the identical sizes, there would be a little moment that my brain does not know which part I should focus first. I like to watch images more than read words, so I prefer to watch large images before I decide to read the whole article. 
¡@¡@One thing I really like about this website is the way it filter things. If you go to the reading part and click any of the filter options, you would see that all books move by themselves. I think it is really cool! Usually, you would be led to a different page, and you would have to wait for your browser to load a different page. Letting objects move instantly is really a great way for users to view things.
