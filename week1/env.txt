Dreamweaver is the dev environment that I feel comfortable with. There are several reasons for that. First, Dreamweaver is the first web design program that I have ever used. Although there are some other tools that have similar features to Dreamweaver, I am still used to Dreamweaver. My favorite feature of Dreamweaver is that it indicates codes with different colors. The colors really make differences when you try to find a certain part of your codes. Although Textmate has the same feature, and it looks simpler, it is not for free. Since I have paid for Adobe CS5, I might just use Dreamweaver!
