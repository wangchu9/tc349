      This site is well designed. The whole page looks clean. There is no extra information on the page. Viewers can read their information without any confusion. They can simply just scroll down from the top and read through all of the contents. That might sound simple for other websites, but it is really not that easy because designers have to place graphs, pictures, buttons, navigations, and texts in a clear style. This site provides enough information to catch viewers’ attention without confusing them. Also, I love the colors they use. They use bright colors to make the whole page look clean and clear.       Moreover, I like the way this site navigates through all of the information. The site has everything on the same page. Viewers do not need to navigate between different web pages. Also, the navigation bar does not just disappear when you scroll down like other websites. It stays on the top of the page even you scroll to the bottom. That design just makes navigating easier for viewers!
