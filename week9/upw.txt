      In my own opinion, the design style of this site satisfies both viewers’ needs and the company’s purpose. This site has both descriptions and photos of the products put into grids. This kind of style allows users to directly see the style of the T-shirts without having to click on every single one of them. Viewers can just scroll down, and they will be able to see all of the T-shirt the site sells. There is no extra information next to those pictures. By eliminating extra information, the home page of the site becomes extremely clean. Although there are no detail descriptions on the home page, viewers can still find detail descriptions on the products that they are interested in by clicking on the products.       Moreover, the use of color on this site is pretty clever. When I clicked into the home page of this site. The colors gave me a feeling of energy. Therefore, I knew this site was definitely selling products for young people. Then, I scrolled down to see more of their products and realized that their products gave me the same impression as their website. I reckon it is important that websites are designed in styles that match their contents. In conclusion, this website is pretty successful.
