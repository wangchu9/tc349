<h2>Final Project Idea</h2>
<p>I would like to create a more professional personal website. I will put my personal information, portfolios, photos, and diaries. Basically, I want to make it look professional so I can use it to show my ability in web design when I apply for jobs in the future. I personally really enjoy the process to make websites simpler and simpler, so I don’t worry about my organizing ability. However, I am pretty weak when it comes to colors, and I realize that you can’t make a professional website without understanding the art of colors. Therefore, I am looking forward to learn about colors in this class!</p>

<h2>Analysis</h2>
<p>Since the primary purpose of this personal website is to show my ability in design, my friends suggested me to eliminate the diary page in order to hide my poor writing skill. Instead, I decided to use short sentences in my albums in grids forms. That would add more information without breaking my principle of simplicity and clean. 
At the beginning, I put news section on my home page because there wasn’t really that much I could put on that page. After sorting and discussion, we decided to eliminate things that are irrelevant to myself. Therefore, we came up with the idea of history of my statuses. For example, I might put a sentence saying “Bryan got back from Japan study abroad on June, 2012.”
