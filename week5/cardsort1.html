<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>We agreed that the current architecture of this site was pretty simple and clear. However, since everyone had different tastes, our results did vary from the orignial archtecture. The differences were mainly on the Home page and the About page. According to our results, 3 out of 4 of us   moved the price and the shipping information from the Home page to the About page. We would like to have visitors to be attracted by the amazing products first using photos and video ads. Once visitors become interested in the products, they will automaticly go into the About page to discover more information. Also, we came to a conclusion that people might lose their interests if they see the price before they see the products. </p>
