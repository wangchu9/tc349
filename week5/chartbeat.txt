\f1 In my own opinion, this is a great website. Not only it has little tools on the main page but also manages to keep the page simple. I like the way they use big fonts and different font colors. Also, the webpage is divided into several different sections using different colors. In each section, it uses different fonts and font colors to demonstrate different style. What really impressed me was that it still manages to keep every section simple and easy to understand! \

\cf0 	Moreover, the little tools on the main page are really interesting. I can\'92t stop watching how the number of people on the sites changes over time. Also, the scrolling tool is really fun too. It makes me keep scrolling to see how the number changes.\
